Everyone likes eating out with friends. The more friends, the better, but the bill time is always a bummer, to say the least. Why not develop a tool to keep the fun alive and make sure that everyone pays an equal amount.

### Learning outcomes
Work on your Python basics such as loops, take a look at more advanced data structures like dictionaries and the random module, and learn how to handle occurring errors and exceptions. You can also get to know the Pycharm Edu IDE while developing an app for managing expenses during your next dine-out.ll.
