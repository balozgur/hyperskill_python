Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

### Learning outcomes
Get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions

## Stage 1/5: Chatty Bot welcomes you : 
### Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console.
- Introduction to Python
- Overview of the basic program
- Multi-line programs

## Stage 2/5 Print your name:
### Introduce yourself to the bot.
- PEP 8
- Comments
- Basic data types
- Variables
- Taking input
- Stage implementation

## Stage 3/5 Guess the age:
### Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age.
- Naming variables
- Integer arithmetic
- Program with numbers

## Stage 4/5 Learning numbers :
### Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply a while loop at this stage!
- Boolean logic
- Comparisons
- If statement
- While loop

## Stage 5/5 Multiple choice :
### At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple-choice questions. Add some functions to your code and make the stage even better.
- Invoking a function
- Declaring a function
- List
- Else statement
- Indexes
